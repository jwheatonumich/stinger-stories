Friends, family, and strangers alike asked — Why?&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fair question!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why does the world need yet another literary magazine?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mainstream publications are for-profit companies. Their sole purpose is to make money. They need to publish literature that their paying readers enjoy, but they won’t take risks publishing something that their editors think is great but the financial analysts think could lose money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What about small publishers?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small publishers may be willing to look at writing that is outside of the mainstream, but they often have as much of a financial focus as mainstream publishers. A small publisher is often interested in one question — how many anthologies will this story help sell? Or for virtual publications, how many visitors will this story bring to our advertisement filled website?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;But there are hundreds, maybe thousands of non-profit magazines, right? Why does the world need another one?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many, many non-profit magazines in the world. And most of them are staffed by a small team of editors who spend numerous hours every week sifting through submissions to find one or two stories that will be the perfect fit for their magazine. And what they produce is wonderful. This collaboration between editor and writer without financial motivation is art in its purest form. But there are many authors whose very worthy writing either does not fit into the narrow scope of one of these non-profit magazines, or whose work will sit in a publishing queue for months or years because there is already such a large backlog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What will Stinger Stories do that existing publications do not?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A writing professor once told me, “Books are written for customers. Short stories are written for the love of writing.” If that is true, flash fiction must be the truest form of literary love. Stinger Stories will publish flash fiction with fewer than 300 words that is science fiction, fantasy, horror, or any other flavor of the unreal. While these stories are not going to interest for-profit magazines, I believe they are some of the simplest and most true expressions of an author’s muse.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Stinger Stories Team</name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html">Earlier this year we launched a literary magazine named Stinger Stories.

&lt;p&gt;Deceived by him, the children of Man cast out the Great Goddess Danna, Queen of the Heavens, Creatrix of the Cosmos. They drove her into the wilderness where she lived alone. In despair, she tore off her starry robes to embrace winter and death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The North Wind swirled around her, caressing her breasts, her belly, her great haunches. She conceived and fell into the snow, as still and cold as stone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the sun rose, Danna shook off the frost, sending it sparkling in the still morning light. Taking up her cloak, she entered the village of Man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spring came, then summer as she grew great with child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the autumn, as leaves blazed yellow and scarlet, the villagers demanded, “Who is the father of your child?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She replied, “I am a virgin and have known no man.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Liar!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I speak the truth. I conceived by the North Wind.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Witch! Consort of demons.” They drove her from the warmth of the fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She went from house to house pounding on doors. “I am Wisdom herself. Let me in.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Begone! Whore of Babylon.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rejected by all, she went into the darkness. In the depths of winter, the longest night of the year, she wailed with the pain of labor. None came to her aid. The child slid from her womb wet with blood onto the frosty, white ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wolves drew in, the Wolves of Danna, the twelve ravenous months of the year. Their eyes glowed like embers as they circled like stars around a black hole, fangs bared, jaws open, ready to devour the child.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Lizzie Newell</name></author><category term="story" /><category term="slipstream" /><summary type="html">When Woman and Man lived on Earth, before Noah loaded his ark with life and carried it across the galaxy, Man declared himself supreme and forced his children to bow down to the idol of Fatherhood.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Re: Pete</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/re-pete" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Re: Pete" /><published>2020-08-29T01:01:01-05:00</published><updated>2020-08-29T01:01:01-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/re-pete</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/re-pete">&lt;p&gt;Pete woke-up to the pain of a hangover. He never drank anymore, but last night…&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The familiar sound of rain beat against his window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He sat up and took stock of his room. A complete mess. He never used to mind it, but now the disarray made his bedroom feel like a prison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He searched through a pile of clothes and pulled on the shirt and pants that smelled the least. He avoided looking in his mirror as he got out of bed. He didn’t need a reminder that his haircut was terrible. He expertly navigated a mess of pens and receipts in his nightstand to grab a lone Tylenol, which he washed down with a stale glass of water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pete paused as he reached his apartment’s living room. He didn’t need to hear the light snoring to know Nadine was asleep on the couch. Their argument the night before had taken a vile turn, and he knew if he woke her she would still be mad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He considered doing it anyways; the fight was so familiar at this point it was almost comforting. Instead quietly grabbed his phone, keys, and wallet in the dark and quietly left the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He knew his building’s elevator would be broken, so he took the stairs. On the way down he navigated a minefield of discarded food and dog droppings without looking. He reached under the last flight of stairs and grabbed a well-hidden umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He opened the umbrella and headed off towards Cafe Ambrosia at a brisk pace. If he got there after 7:05am the waitress always screwed up his order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may be the worst day of his life, but no need to make it any worse than necessary. No matter how many times he had to relive it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>James Heaton</name></author><category term="post" /><summary type="html">Pete woke-up to the pain of a hangover.

&lt;p&gt;I am writing to you regarding the condition of your castle’s dungeon. I can honestly say it is one of the three worst dungeons I have ever seen. This comes from someone with a LOT of experience in dungeons.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, there is a serious hygiene problem. While I realize that mold is sometimes unavoidable in damp and enclosed spaces, would an occasional sanitization be out of the question?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, it is disappointing you have been unable to find better quality wardens. The short goblin guarding my cell barely speaks English. Is he (or she?) even authorized to work in this country?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, I cannot recommend your organization until you remedy the food situation. There was no vegetarian option, and the dire-rat stew was cold by the time I was served.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you in advance for your prompt attention,&lt;/p&gt;
