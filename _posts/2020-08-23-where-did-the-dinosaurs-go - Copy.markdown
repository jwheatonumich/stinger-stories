Clouds rolled in

Rex sat at the base of the boat

sulking<!--more-->


“Sorry, but there’s just no room

and after the incident with the other dinosaurs..."


The first drops of rain fell

Rex did his best sad puppy impression

Noah retracted the gangway

leading the last of the animals 

two-by-two 

into the Ark
