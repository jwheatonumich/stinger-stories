Dear Malifica,

I am writing to let you know that your dungeon is in very poor condition. This comes from someone with a LOT of experience in dungeons.

First, cleanliness. While I realize that mold is sometimes unavoidable in damp and enclosed spaces, would an occasional sanitization be out of the question?

Also, it is disappointing you have been unable to find better quality wardens. The short goblin guarding my cell barely speaks English. Is he (or she?) even authorized to work in this country?

And finally, I cannot recommend your organization until you remedy the food situation. There was no vegetarian option, and the rat stew was cold by the time I was served.

Thank you in advance for your prompt attention,

Karen the Brave
