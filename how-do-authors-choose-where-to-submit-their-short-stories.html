            <p id="description"> <p>Earlier this year we launched Stinger Stories, an online publication for short works of science fiction, fantasy, and other fantastical stories.</p>

<p>As a group of aspiring writers with no background in web development, marketing, search engine optimization, or any other practical skills, we were able to create a website, attract talented authors, and get our work in front of a large audience. <!--more--></p>

<p>This is the first of a series of four articles that describe how we got our publication up-and-running. This first piece describes how we try to make our magazine an appetizing place for authors to submit their short stories.</p>

<p><b>Getting Quality Writing</b></p>

<p>A publication is only as good as the writing it publishes. High quality content is going to come from skilled authors. So how does a new publication find authors?</p>

<ul>
<li>Yourself — Being a competent writer is the single most important skill when it comes to starting a new publication. Somebody is going to have to write the first piece for your publication (and the second, and the third…) before there are any readers. And those first few pieces are what other authors will look at when considering whether they want their work to be displayed on your site.</li>

<li>Personal Network — Having friends or connections that write is invaluable when building your publication’s initial body of work. Any friend who submits work to your fledgling publication is doing you a solid, so show your gratitude! But at the same time, don’t compromise the theme or level of quality just because you know the author.</li>

<li>Local Writers — Most moderately sized towns and cities have local writers groups. These can take many forms, from an informal group that meets at the local coffeehouse to groups on social platforms such as Meetup, Facebook, or any number of other websites. Get involved with these. They are a resource that none of the major publications have access to, and many local writers have piles of unpublished work. If you offer them a professional looking place to showcase their work, they might surprise you with some gems.</li>

<li>Direct Requests — Once you have a modest following, teaming-up with more established writers can be synergistic — you both effectively double your audience. Note that this will only really work once you start to build a following. Direct solicitations for work on a half built site without any readership is not a tempting offer.</li>

<li>Unsolicited (“Slush”) Submissions — Most publications have a submissions page that asks writers to submit content that fits their magazine. These submissions are insultingly called “slush”, describing the process of digging through a puddle of content that the editor doesn’t want to find a few that are good fits. This process is the bread and butter of a publication. Most of the content a moderately sized magazine publishes comes as unsolicited submissions. The success of a publication will rely on the editorial team’s ability to attract high quality submissions and quickly find them. Always remember that good quality content has an expiry timer. If you take too long to find and accept it, the author will go elsewhere.</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Keeping Writers</b></p>

<p>Sufficiently popular publications don’t have trouble attracting submissions. There are thousands upon thousands of authors who want their work published. The trouble is, most of the pieces that get submitted are going to be poor quality or poor fits. Why? Because high quality writing is snapped up fast. Poor quality writing will sit unpublished for eternity, doomed to be endlessly submit and rejected.
When your publication receives a high quality submission your editorial team needs to find it and accept it quickly. To keep authors from jumping ship, create a timeline that you will follow that includes (1) letting the author know their piece was received, (2) informing the author of acceptance/rejection, and (3) providing the date the piece will be published. Post this timeline on your submissions page. Always adhere to it. It is better to temporarily close submissions, rather than cause irreparable damage to your publication’s reputation among authors. And trust me when I say authors are paying attention to these factors.</p>

<p><b>Standards</b></p>

<p>It may be tempting to accept low quality work, or content that is unrelated to your publication’s intended theme, particularly when you are just starting and your inbox is nearly empty. Our advice is simple — don’t. If you start to publishing low quality work then potential writers will take notice, and the good ones won’t submit their work. At the end of the day, a publication with a few high-quality stories or poems adds more to the world than a dumping ground for low quality, low effort pieces.</p>
